CURATIVE PETITION UNDER ARTICLE 142 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA

MOST RESPECTFULLY SHEWETH:

1. That the petitioner is a medical doctor practicing in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, and is a law-abiding citizen of India.

2. That the petitioner was falsely implicated in a criminal case under Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, based on fabricated evidence.

3. That the petitioner was convicted by the Trial Court and sentenced to three years of rigorous imprisonment, which was upheld by the High Court of Allahabad.

4. That the petitioner filed a Special Leave Petition before this Hon'ble Court, which was dismissed on 10th December 2023.

5. That the petitioner has now discovered conclusive evidence that proves her innocence beyond any reasonable doubt, which was not available at the time of the original proceedings.

GROUNDS FOR CURATIVE PETITION:

A. VIOLATION OF PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL JUSTICE:
   The petitioner was denied a fair opportunity to present her defense as crucial evidence proving her innocence was suppressed by the investigating agency and was not available during the trial.

B. DISCOVERY OF CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE:
   After the dismissal of the Special Leave Petition, the petitioner has discovered:
   - CCTV footage from the hospital where the alleged incident occurred, which completely exonerates the petitioner;
   - Medical records that prove the petitioner was not present at the location on the date of the alleged incident;
   - Witness statements that were deliberately withheld by the prosecution.

C. GRAVE MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE:
   The conviction of the petitioner, who is an innocent medical professional, amounts to a grave miscarriage of justice and would cause irreparable damage to her professional reputation and career.

D. VIOLATION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS:
   The continued conviction of the petitioner violates her fundamental rights under Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution of India, as she is being punished for a crime she did not commit.

E. PUBLIC INTEREST:
   It is in the public interest to correct this miscarriage of justice, as the petitioner is a medical professional whose services are valuable to society, and her continued conviction would deprive the public of her medical expertise.

PRAYER:

In view of the above facts and circumstances, it is most respectfully prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to:

a) Allow this curative petition and review the judgment dated 10th December 2023 passed in Civil Appeal No. 5678 of 2023;

b) Set aside the conviction and sentence imposed on the petitioner;

c) Direct the respondents to conduct a fresh investigation into the matter;

d) Award appropriate compensation to the petitioner for the wrongful conviction and the mental agony suffered;

e) Pass such other order or orders as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case.

VERIFICATION:

I, DR. PRIYA SHARMA, the petitioner herein, do hereby solemnly affirm and state that the contents of paragraphs 1 to 5 are true to my knowledge and the contents of paragraphs A to E are true to my information and belief, and no part of it is false and nothing material has been concealed therefrom.

Verified at Noida on this 30th day of January 2024.
