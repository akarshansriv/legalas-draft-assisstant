PETITION FOR REVIEW UNDER ARTICLE 137 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA

MOST RESPECTFULLY SHEWETH:

1. That the petitioner is a partnership firm engaged in the business of construction and real estate development.

2. That the petitioner had entered into a construction contract with the respondent for the development of a commercial complex in Mumbai.

3. That disputes arose between the parties regarding the quality of construction and payment terms, which were referred to arbitration.

4. That the Arbitral Tribunal passed an award in favor of the respondent, which was challenged by the petitioner before the High Court of Bombay.

5. That the High Court dismissed the petitioner's challenge to the arbitral award, against which the petitioner filed Civil Appeal No. 1234 of 2023 before this Hon'ble Court.

6. That this Hon'ble Court dismissed the civil appeal vide judgment dated 15th January 2024, which is now sought to be reviewed.

GROUNDS FOR REVIEW:

A. ERROR APPARENT ON THE FACE OF THE RECORD:
   The judgment under review contains an error apparent on the face of the record as it failed to consider the crucial evidence regarding the defective construction work, which was duly documented and submitted before the Arbitral Tribunal.

B. DISCOVERY OF NEW AND IMPORTANT MATTER:
   After the judgment was pronounced, the petitioner has discovered new and important evidence in the form of structural integrity reports from independent experts, which conclusively prove that the construction work was indeed defective and did not meet the contractual specifications.

C. MISTAKE OR ERROR ON THE FACE OF THE RECORD:
   The judgment contains a fundamental mistake in interpreting the terms of the construction contract, particularly with respect to the quality standards and specifications agreed upon between the parties.

D. ANY OTHER SUFFICIENT REASON:
   The judgment, if allowed to stand, would cause irreparable loss and injury to the petitioner, as it would be compelled to pay for defective construction work that does not meet the agreed standards.

PRAYER:

In view of the above facts and circumstances, it is most respectfully prayed that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to:

a) Allow this review petition and review the judgment dated 15th January 2024 passed in Civil Appeal No. 1234 of 2023;

b) Set aside the judgment under review and remand the matter for fresh consideration;

c) Grant an opportunity to the petitioner to adduce the newly discovered evidence;

d) Pass such other order or orders as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case.
